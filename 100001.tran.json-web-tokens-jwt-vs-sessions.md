## What is JWT?

> In essence it's a signed piece of data in JSON format. Because it's signed the recipient can verify its authenticity. Because it's JSON it weights very little. If you are after the formal definition, it's in the [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

_This article was featured [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11929267). Have a look at the [case study](https://float-middle.com/i-got-featured-on-hacker-news-case-study/) exposing analytics, SEO impact, performance hit and more._

Signed data is nothing new - what's thrilling here is how JWT can be used to create truly RESTful services, with no sessions. As it turns out the the idea has been around for a while. Here's how it works in physical world - I will draw the analogies straight after:

Imagine you are coming back to your country from holidays abroad. You are at the border and you say - you can pass me through, I'm a homie. All fine and dandy but how can you support your claim? Most probably you are carrying a passport confirming your identity. Let's assume the border staff has all that is required to tell for sure if the passport is genuinely issued the Passport Office of your country. The passport proves to be in order and they let you through.

Now, let's look at the story from JWT perspective to see who is who:

*   **The Passport Office** - authentication service which issued the JWT.
*   **Passport** - your JWT signed by the Passport Office. Your identity is readable to everyone who looks at it but interested parties can verify if it's genuine.
*   **Citizenship** - your claim contained in the JWT (your passport).
*   **Border** - security layer in your app verifying the JWT token before granting access to a secured resource, in this case - the country.
*   **Country** - resource you want access to (e.g. API).

## Look ma, no session!

In very simple terms, JWT are cool because you don't need to keep session data on the server in order to authenticate the user. The workflow goes like so:

*   The user calls authentication service, usually sending username and password.
*   The authentication service responds with a signed JWT, which says who the user is.
*   The user requests access to a secured service sending the token back.
*   Security layer checks the signature on the token and if it's genuine the access is granted.

Let's think for a moment about the consequences.

### No session storage

No sessions means no session storage. Sounds like not much unless your applications needs to scale horizontally. If your application is run on multiple servers then sharing the session data becomes a burden. You either need a specialised server just for session storage or shared disk space or sticky sessions on the load balancer. None of that is needed when you don't use sessions.

### No garbage collection for sessions

Usually sessions need to be expired and garbage collected. JWT can carry its own expiry date along with the user data. Therefore the security layer checking JWT's authenticity can also check the expiry time and simply refuse access.

### Truly RESTful services

Only without sessions you can create truly RESTful services, as they are supposed to be [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Stateless). JWT is small so it can be sent with each request, just like a session cookie. Unlike the session cookie however, it does not point to any data stored on the server, JWT has the data.

## How does JWT look, exactly?

There is one thing we need get straight before we dive in any further. JWT is not a thing of its own. It is a type of either [JSON Web Signature (JWS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) or [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516). Definition time:

> The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure

The former gives us just the signature and the data it contains (or the "claims" as they call it in JWT nomenclature) is readable to anyone. The latter offers encryption, so only someone with a key can decrypt it. The JWS implementation is much easier and the basic usage does not require encryption - after all if you have a key on the client you may as well leave the whole thing unencrypted. Therefore JWS is used in most cases and so I am going to focus on it here.

### So what goes into the JWT/JWS?

*   **Header** - information about the signing algorithm, the type of payload (JWT) and so on in JSON format.
*   **Payload** - the actual data (or claims if you like) in JSON format.
*   **Signature** - well... the signature.

I will explain the details later on. For now let's analyse the basics.

Each part mentioned above (header, payload and signature) is base64url-encoded, then they are glued together with a `.` to form JWT. Here is how the implementation could look like:

```
var header = {  
        // The signing algorithm.
        "alg": "HS256",
        // The type (typ) property says it's "JWT",
        // because with JWS you can sign any type of data.
        "typ": "JWT"
    },
    // Base64 representation of the header object.
    headerB64 = btoa(JSON.stringify(header)),
    // The payload here is our JWT claims.
    payload = {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "admin": true
    },
    // Base64 representation of the payload object.
    payloadB64 = btoa(JSON.stringify(payload)),
    // The signature is calculated on the base64 representation
    // of the header and the payload.
    signature = signatureCreatingFunction(headerB64 + '.' + payloadB64),
    // Base64 representation of the signature.
    signatureB64 = btoa(signature),
    // Finally, the whole JWS - all base64 parts glued together with a '.'
    jwt = headerB64 + '.' + payloadB64 + '.' + signatureB64;

```

The resulting JWS looks neat and sweet and somewhat like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9obiBEb2UiLCJhZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZX0.OLvs36KmqB9cmsUrMpUutfhV52_iSz4bQMYJjkI_TLQ  

```

You can play around with creating the tokens on [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/#debugger) website.

Quite an important thing is that the the signature is calculated for both the header and the payload in one go. Thus the authenticity of the header and the payload can be easily checked in one go as well:

```
[headerB64, payloadB64, signatureB64] = jwt.split('.');

if (atob(signatureB64) === signatureCreatingFunction(headerB64 + '.' + payloadB64) {  
    // good
} else
    // no good
}

```

### JWT header 中可以有什么参数？

其实，JWT header 叫做 JOSE header，JOSE 是 JSON Object Sigining and Encrytion 的缩写。JWS (JSON Web Sign) 和JWE (JSON Web Encryption) 也同样有这样的header，虽然每一种都有的稍不一样的标准参数集合 。下面的列表给出了JWS 的header中的标准参数。除了第一个（alg）之外，其他的参数都是可选的：

*   **alg** Algorithm 算法 (必须有)
*   **typ** Type (如果有的话，JWT header 中 Type 需要是`JWT`)
*   **kid** Key ID
*   **cty** Content Type
*   **jku** JWK Set URL
*   **jwk** JSON Web Key
*   **x5u** X.509 URL 
*   **x5c** X.509 Certificate Chain
*   **x5t** X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint
*   **x5t#S256** X.509 Certificate SHA-256 Thumbprint
*   **crit** Critical

头两个参数最经常使用，因此标准的header 看起来有点像下面这个样子：

```
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}

```

上面的第三个header参数，`kid` ，是出于安全因素的考虑。`cty` 则是只能在嵌套的JWT中使用（译者：参考一些[github代码(line:42-47)](https://github.com/luishdosreis/flasktaskr/blob/a1eddf5d5b629b8737a1956d4d46df84b69c8aa2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/jwt/tests/test_jwt.py) 如果是嵌套的JWT, 即JWT之后又JWT一次的，cty  是 `JWT` ）。剩下的你可以在[这里的标准说明](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1)中读到,我是觉得这些超出了本文范围。

#### `alg` (algorithm 算法)

`alg`参数的值可以是[JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1) 中声明的任一种（是，我知道这又是一份标准说明），JWS 中注册的算法列表如下：

*   **HS256** - HMAC using SHA-256
*   **HS384** - HMAC using SHA-384
*   **HS512** - HMAC using SHA-512
*   **RS256** - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256
*   **RS384** - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384
*   **RS512** - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512
*   **ES256** - ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256
*   **ES384** - ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384
*   **ES512** - ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512
*   **PS256** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256
*   **PS384** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384
*   **PS512** - RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512
*   **none** - No digital signature or MAC performed（不使用数字签名或MAC）

请留意最后一个，`none`,从安全的角度看是最值得关注的 。[它被用作降级攻击](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/)（译者：15年的一篇文章，是当时JWT的一些实现上的严重漏洞，参考这个[360安全播报](http://bobao.360.cn/news/detail/1377.html)）. 它是如何攻击的呢？想象一个由攻击者构造出来的JWT，它在header里声明签名算法是`none`并发送过来请求验证。如果认证方（可信发布方）比较愚蠢，它会使用这个`alg`参数并授予请求者不应该有的权限。

原则上是，应用的安全层次上应该始终对header的`alg`参数持审慎态度，这就是`kid`参数便利的地方。


#### `typ` (type)

这个参数含义相当直白，如果明确知道这是一个JWT请求（因为应用根本就不会有其他类别），这个参数可以忽略掉。因此，它是一个可选参数。如果一定要有，值就应该是大写的`JWT`。

在某些情况下，如果应用接收非JWT请求和`JWT`，那么声明`typ`就非常重要，否则应用就疯掉了。

#### `kid` (key id)

如果你的应用的安全层只用一种算法来签名JWT请求，那么就不用担心`alg`参数了，因为你始终会用同样的key 和算法来检查token的完整性。但是，要是用了一系列不同的算法和key，就必须要能够确认token是哪个算出来的。

像前面那样，只依靠`alg`参数可能会导致一些麻烦。但是如果你的应用有一组`key－算法`对,并且每对都有一个名字或id，你就可以在把 key id加到header里，然后在`JWT`认证过程中就有更多的信息用来挑选算法了。这就是`kid`参数 － 你用来签名token的key的id。

id 可以是任意的，取决于你赋的值。最重要的是这个－你给出去的，所以你能够验证它。

#### `cty` (content type)

[The spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-5.2) is pretty clear here, so I will just quote:

> In the normal case in which nested signing or encryption operations are not employed, the use of this Header Parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED. In the case that nested signing or encryption is employed, this Header Parameter MUST be present; in this case, the value MUST be "JWT", to indicate that a Nested JWT is carried in this JWT. While media type names are not case sensitive, it is RECOMMENDED that "JWT" always be spelled using uppercase characters for compatibility with legacy implementations.

### What can be in the JWT claims?

Doesn't the name "claims" bother you? It did bother me at first. I believe you need to repeat that a few times in order to get used to it. In simple terms, the claims are the meat of the JWT - this is the data that we care so much about as to sign it. It's called "claims" because usually that's what it is - the client claims that the username, user role or whatever else is such that it would grant him access to the resources he's after.

Remember that lovely story I told you at the beginning? Your citizenship was the claim and your passport - the JWT.

You can put whatever you wish in the claims, there is however a [registered list](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1), which should be universally recognised amongst implementations. Please note that each of them is optional and processing for most of them is application specific. Here's the list:

*   **exp** - Expiration Time
*   **nbf** - Not Before
*   **iat** - Issued At
*   **sub** - Subject
*   **iss** - Issuer
*   **aud** - Audience
*   **jti** - JWT ID

It's worth noting that except for the last three (issuer, audience and JWT ID) are usually used in more complex cases, e.g. with multiple issuers. Let's get on with it, then.

#### `exp` (expiration date)

Timestamp indicating when the token becomes invalid. The spec says that "the current date/time MUST be before" the value specified in the `exp` claim in order to allow processing of the token. It is also indicated that some leeway (a few minutes) is allowed in order to account for clock skew.

#### `nbf` (not before)

Timestamp indicating when the token becomes valid. The spec says that "the current date/time MUST be after or equal" the value specified in the `nbf` claim in order to allow processing of the token. It is also indicated that some leeway (a few minutes) is allowed in order to account for clock skew.

#### `iat` (issued at)

Timestamp indicating when the token has been issued.

#### `sub` (subject)

As the spec says "the claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject". Subject must be unique within the context of the issuer or globally unique. The `sub` claim can be used to identify the user, for example [JIRA](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/concepts/understanding-jwt.html#token-structure-claims) does that.

#### `iss` (issuer)

String value identifying the issuer of the token. If the value contains `:` it has to be an URI. It can be useful if there are many issuers with one security layer and the application needs to identify the issuer. For example [Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm) require to use OAuth client_id as the `iss` value.

#### `aud` (audience)

String or an array of strings identifying the intended recipient(s) of the token. If the string contains `:` it has to be an URI. Often used as an URI of the resource for which the claims are valid. For example, in [OAuth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#section-3) the audience is the authorisation server. The application processing the token must verify that the audience is correct or reject the token if it is intended for different audience.

#### `jti` (JWT id)

Unique identifier for the token. This value must be unique for each issued token, even if there are many issuers. The `jti` claim can be used for one-time tokens, which cannot be replayed.

## How to use JWT in my application?

In the most common scenario, the client in the browser will authenticate in the authentication service and receive JWT in return. Then the client stores the token somehow (e.g. memory, localStorage) and sends it back with every request for a protected resource. Usually the token is sent as a cookie or `Authorization` header in HTTP request:

```
GET /api/secured-resource HTTP/1.1  
Host: example.com  
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9obiBEb2UiLCJhZG1pbiI6dHJ1ZX0.OLvs36KmqB9cmsUrMpUutfhV52_iSz4bQMYJjkI_TLQ  

```

The header method is preferred for security reasons - cookies would be susceptible to [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) (Cross Site Request Forgery) unless CSRF tokens were used.

Secondly, the cookies can be sent back only to the same domain (or at most second level domain) they were issued from. If the authentication service resides on a different domain, cookies require much more wild creativeness.

### How to log out with JWT?

Because there is no session date stored on the service side, logging out cannot be performed by destroying the session. Therefore logging out is the client's responsibility - as soon as the client forgets the token it cannot be authorised any more and therefore can be considered logged out.

## Conclusion

I think JWTs are a very clever way of authorising without sessions. They allow for creating truly RESTful services with no state remembered on the service side, meaning no session storage is required either.

Unlike session cookies automatically sent by the browser to any URL matching the domain/path combination (let's be honest, it's just the domain in most cases), JWTs can be selectively sent only to the resources requiring authorisation.

The implementation is pretty simple, both on the client and on the server, especially that there are specialised [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) for signing and verifying the tokens.
